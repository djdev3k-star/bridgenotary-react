**Purpose:** Review all website content for Texas notary law compliance

## 1. HOMEPAGE - HERO SECTION

### Current Copy:
```
"Your Trusted Partner for Secure Closings"

"Bridge Notary offers professional, reliable, and convenient mobile notary 
and loan signing services for title companies, lenders, and real estate professionals."
```

### Issues Found:
- ✅ **SAFE** - No legal advice language
- ✅ **SAFE** - No attorney claims
- ⚠️ **FLAG** - "Secure Closings" could imply legal protection (notaries don't provide legal security)

### Recommended Rewrite:
```
"Your Professional Notary Partner"

"Bridge Notary provides expert mobile notary and loan signing services 
for title companies, lenders, and real estate professionals."
```

**Why:** "Trusted Partner" + "Secure Closings" could imply you're responsible for legal outcomes. 
"Professional" is safer—notaries authenticate, they don't secure legally.

## 2. SERVICES OVERVIEW

### Current Copy:
```
"Professional Notary Solutions"

"From loan signings to international document authentication—we handle every 
notarization need with expertise and reliability."
```

### Issues Found:
- ✅ **SAFE** - "handle every notarization need" is appropriate
- ✅ **SAFE** - No legal advice
- ✅ **SAFE** - Clear service scope

### Compliance Status:
✅ COMPLIANT - No changes needed

---

## 3. LOAN SIGNING SERVICES

### Current Copy:
```
Service Types:
- Refinance Signing: "$125–$150"
- Purchase Signing: "$100–$125"
- Seller Signing: "$75–$100"
- Reverse Mortgage: "$125–$175"
- HELOC / Home Equity: "$100–$150"
- Loan Modification: "$40–$60"
- Commercial Closing: "[Price]"
```

### Issues Found:
- ✅ **SAFE** - Simple service listing
- ✅ **SAFE** - Clear scope (signing, not legal representation)
- ⚠️ **FLAG** - No disclaimer that you're NOT handling legal review

### Recommended Addition:
Add footer disclaimer on pricing pages:
```
"Bridge Notary provides notarization and document witnessing services only. 
We do not provide legal advice, legal representation, or legal review. 
Clients should consult an attorney for any legal questions."
```

---

## 4. REMOTE ONLINE NOTARIZATION (RON)

### Current Copy:
```
"Remote Online Notarization"

"Legally binding video notarization with identity verification and audit trail."
```

### Issues Found:
- ✅ **SAFE** - RON is legally binding when performed correctly
- ✅ **SAFE** - Mentions identity verification (required for RON)
- ✅ **SAFE** - Audit trail mentioned
- ⚠️ **FLAG** - Should clarify who determines legality & what documents can/cannot be notarized

### Recommended Rewrite:
```
"Remote Online Notarization (RON)"

"Video-based notarization with identity verification and audit trail. 
Performed in compliance with Texas Notary Public Act. Not all documents 
can be notarized remotely—consult us about your specific documents."
```

**Why:** RON has restrictions (can't notarize certain documents like some powers of attorney). 
Adding "consult us" avoids implying you can notarize anything.

---

## 5. APOSTILLE SERVICES

### Current Copy:
```
"From destination weddings to studying abroad—stop guessing. Start traveling, 
marrying, studying, or doing business abroad—confident your documents will 
cross borders as smoothly as you do."
```

### Issues Found:
- ⚠️ **FLAG** - "confident your documents will cross borders" implies legal guarantee
- ⚠️ **FLAG** - "stop guessing" could imply you're providing legal guidance on what's needed
- ⚠️ **FLAG** - No disclaimer about apostille limitations & foreign requirements

### Recommended Rewrite:
```
"Apostille Authentication Services"

"Apostilles verify the authenticity of U.S. public documents for use abroad. 
Each country has different apostille requirements—we handle the authentication. 
For legal questions about what documents you need, consult the relevant 
foreign agency or an international law attorney."
```

**Why:** Makes clear: (1) what apostille does, (2) you don't advise on legal requirements, 
(3) foreign agencies set requirements, not you.

## 6. SENIOR SERVICES

### Current Copy (if present):
```
[Check for: "We handle senior documentation" or similar language]

### Critical Alert:

### Required Disclaimers:

"Bridge Notary provides notarization services only. We do NOT:
- Provide legal advice
- Determine document validity
- Represent your interests
- Advise on tax or financial consequences

Consult an attorney licensed in Texas for estate planning, 
powers of attorney, and legal document review."
```

---

## 7. CONTACT FORM / INTAKE

### Current Copy:
```
"Send us a message and we'll respond quickly."
```

### Issues Found:
- ✅ **SAFE** - No legal advice implied
- ✅ **SAFE** - Simple CTA

### Recommended Addition:
Add field or checkbox for intake:
```

  and not legal advice. I will consult an attorney for legal questions.
```

```
[Check for: "bonded", "insured", "protected", "guaranteed"]
```

### Compliance Check:
- ✅ OK to say: "Notary is bonded" (required in TX)
